## Supported Versions / Versioning

As of writting, there is no versioning practice being enforced. Currently, it should be assumed, unless stated otherwise, that the most recent update(s)/modification(s) should be considered as the usable version. Once the development phase is completed, versioning will start with 1.0.0.

The first digit refers to a specific iteration of the program and is assumed things have been completed changed visually and/or code-wise.

The second digit refers to when additions and/or removals have taken place in reference to the first digit.

The third digit refers to bug fixes and/or optimizations that have been implimented in refernce to the second digit.

There is no standard when different versions will be released; however, bug fixes and/or optimizations should be considered a higher priority over everything else unless implimenting or removing features superceeds this in some way.
